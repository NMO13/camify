# camify

Camify is a CNC machine simulation which can be used for 3 axis milling machines. It is developed in C# and uses OpenTk for graphics rendering.

## Features
- Loading of NC program files
- Loading of tools/roughparts
- Preprocessing of the simulation
- 100% correct boolean subtraction performed on triangle meshes
- Calculation of swept volumes generated by tool motion.
- Visual presented machine simulation
- Free rotation of 3D scene
